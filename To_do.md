# To do list:
## High Priority
sRNA visualisation package (isomirs, tissue-specific expression, etc)

Genome visualisation figure - genome size, ploidy, chromosome number, Phylogeny (?) all combined into 1 for key crops, livestock, and models


## Semi-ideas:
Crop price visualisation dashboard from WFP data
https://glomip.cgiar.org/ - portal for rice product data - how to summarise this?

Learn GWAS
  If data from Microbiome homeostasis on rice leaves is regulated by a precursor molecule of lignin biosynthesis is available, this would be cool and has a link to metabolomics as well

DE example for RNA-seq data

DoE example
